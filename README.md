monty - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO ðŸ¥ž
monty functions as a Monty byte code interpreter. Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it.
SYNOPSIS
monty is a simple byte code interpreter in accordance with Holberton School standards and expectations. This project's purpose was to introduce students to working with the stack which is LIFO (last in first out) and the queue, which is FIFO (first in first out).

Objectives:
To know what LIFO and FIFO mean
To know what a stack is, and when to use it
To know what a queue is, and when to use it
To know the common implementations of stacks and queues
To know the most common use cases of stacks and queues
To know the proper way to use global variables
